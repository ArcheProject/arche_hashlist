README arche_hashlist
=====================

Dump plaintext rows, hash them and compare the rows later on.

Note, this requires the salt to be saved and reused, so don't depend on it for super-sensitive things.

Requirements
------------

Uses bcrypt, which requires libffi-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or libffi (Brew / Mac)
